# Easy-framework-for-EI-balance
This is a simple framework to realize excitatory and inhibitory balance. In this project, three kinds of models are exhibited.
The first model is in Model1 shown in Amit & Brunel, 1997:
\begin{equation}
\tau_{m} \dot{V}^{\alpha}(t) =-V^{\alpha}(t)+V_{\text {leak }}+I^{\alpha}(t)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\alpha} \dot{I}_{i}^{\alpha}(t)=-I_{i}
\end{equation}
This is achieved in Model1.
