# Easy-framework-for-EI-balance
# This is a simple framework to realize excitatory and inhibitory balance. In this project, three kinds of models are exhibited.
The first model is in Model1 shown in paper of Amit & Brunel, 1997 with different neuronal constant.  
The second model is in Model2 shown in papers of Amit & Brunel, 1997 and Brunel 2020 when the time constant of the currents is much shorter than that of potentials.  
The third model is the Exponential integrate - and - fire model.
