# Easy-framework-for-EI-balance with external populations of Poisson processes
# This is a simple framework to realize excitatory and inhibitory balance. In this project, three kinds of models are exhibited.
The first model is in Model1 shown in paper of Amit & Brunel, 1997 with different neuronal constant for LIF dynamics.
The second model is in Model2 shown in papers of Amit & Brunel, 1997 and Brunel 2020 when the time constant of the currents is much shorter than that of potentials for LIF dynamics.
The third model is the Exponential integrate - and - fire model.  
The formulation of three models are show in the document of  _Three models for EI balance.pdf_.  
The figures of currents and the network response are shown in the document, which is rarely seen using pure python.

# Requirements
Different environment may cause some functions invalid. You may need to adjust the code details according to your needs. No extra packages are needed, pure python.
