# Easy-framework-for-EI-balance
This is a simple framework to realize excitatory and inhibitory balance. In this project, three kinds of models are exhibited.
The first model is in Model1 shown in Amit & Brunel, 1997:
\begin{equation} 
\tau_{\alpha} \dot{I}_{i}^{\alpha}(t)=-I_{i}^{\alpha}(t) + \tau_{m} \sum_{\beta} \sum_{j}^{C} J_{i j}^{\alpha \beta} \sum_{k} \delta\left(t_{i j}^{k}-t\right) \end{equation}
where
This is achieved in Model1.
